# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
# Weather App

## Description

A weather application built with React that provides current weather information based on user input. It includes a dark mode toggle and displays additional weather details like humidity and wind speed.

## Features

- Fetches current weather information based on user input (city name or zip code).
- Displays location, temperature, date and time, humidity, and wind speed.
- Dark mode and light mode toggle functionality.
- Responsive design for various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Handles API responses and errors gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Axios
- OpenWeather API
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivaji-Bodhas/weather-forecast.git
   cd weather-forecast

2. Install Axios for API requests:
    ```bash
   npm install axios
3.Get your OpenWeather API key:
- Sign up at OpenWeather and get your API key.
   

Usage
1.Enter a city name or zip code in the input field.
2.Click the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display weather information.
3.Toggle between dark mode and light mode using the provided button.  

Known Issues
- Error handling for API responses can be improved.
- The application currently supports only metric units for temperature.

Contributing
1.Fork the repository.
2.Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
3.Make your changes.
4.Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature').
5.Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
6.Open a pull request.  


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
